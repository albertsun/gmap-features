A library for creating Polygon features on a Google Map.

Supports mouseover and click events and having one selected polygon at a time.

Can provide options to style the polygons in each of the three states, and a callback function to do something upon highlighting or selecting a polygon.

Requires jQuery to be available to use KML files

Uses code extracted from http://censusmapmaker.com/ and http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/MTAFARES1108/

If you want to tinker with the code, the file in src/ includes each js file separately. To build them into the final gmap-features.min.js file run ./build.sh
That'll need a the $CLOSURE_PATH for Google's Closure Compiler set. Put something like the below in your .bash_profile
export CLOSURE_PATH='/Users/suna/stuff/closure-compiler/compiler.jar'
